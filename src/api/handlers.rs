The errors you encountered are due to the use of backticks (`` ` ``) instead of single quotes (`'`) or proper delimiters in your Rust code. Backticks are often used in Markdown for code formatting, but are not valid syntax in Rust, hence the compilation errors.

Here’s a corrected version of a basic structure of your Rust code in `src/api/handlers.rs`. I've removed the inappropriate backticks and made sure the code conforms to correct Rust syntax.

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}; // Make sure you include required traits if needed
use tw_chain::utils::druid_utils::druid_expectations_are_met;
use tw_chain::utils::script_utils::{tx_has_valid_create_script, tx_is_valid};
use tw_chain::primitives::transaction::{GenesisTxHashSpec, OutPoint, Transaction, TxOut};
use tw_chain::script::StackEntry;

pub struct FetchPendingData {
    pub druid_list: Vec<String>,
}

/// Struct received from the client to fetch pending transactions
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub struct PendingDataRequest {
    // Add necessary fields according to your request structure
}

// Further code logic and functionalities should be added here
```

### Key Changes:
1. Removed backticks and replaced them with comments where appropriate.
2. Ensured all imports are included correctly.
3. Presented a plausible structure for the `PendingDataRequest` — make sure to add necessary fields relevant to your project.

Ensure you fill in any additional logic and structs as required by your application. This should help you compile the code without errors regarding token issues.
